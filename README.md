# Login-Form-Project


## Project Description: Login Form with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### Overview: This project focuses on creating a user-friendly and secure login form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is designed to collect user credentials (such as username and password) and validate them before submission. The login form is styled with CSS to provide a visually appealing and responsive user interface. JavaScript is used to handle form validation and enhance the overall functionality of the form.

## Key Features:

### User Interface Design (HTML + CSS):

#### The login form includes input fields for a username/email and password.
#### Labels, placeholders, and submit buttons are added to create a seamless user experience.
#### The form is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
#### A clean and modern layout is achieved using CSS, with the form being centered on the page and styled with colors, fonts, and borders for an attractive appearance.

##Form Validation (JavaScript):

#### JavaScript is used to validate user inputs, ensuring that both the username/email and password fields are not left empty.
#### Password strength can be checked (e.g., ensuring it meets a minimum length requirement).
#### The form will display error messages when the user fails to meet the validation criteria, helping to guide the user to input correct information.
#### JavaScript also provides an alert or message to notify users if their login is successful or if their credentials are incorrect.

## Technologies Used:

### HTML5: Used to create the structure and layout of the login form.
### CSS3: Used for styling and responsiveness.
### JavaScript: Used to implement form validation and interactivity.

## Project Goals:

#### To create a clean and functional login form.
#### To ensure proper validation of user input on the client-side.
#### To enhance the user experience through a responsive and intuitive design.
#### To practice the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a real-world application.
